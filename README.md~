# Infinity Translate

- Performing Google Translate on non-editable PDF's or PDF's that are created from images is not possible. The only solution to extract text from these documents is to perform *OCR* or Optical Character Recognition.
- The application performs translation *to* and *from* the languages : English, German, Dutch, Cantonese, Malay, Irish, Spanish, French, Japanese


### Local Setup and Usage

- The repository can be forked or cloned
- The dependencies can be installed by running  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `Poppler` must be installed and added to the path
- The Google Translate API has been used , this needs creation of an account on Google Cloud Platform (the 300 dollar credit for a 1 year period can be used here)
- This video can be used to enable the Google Translation service : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hTlSGD4_zk
- The next step is to obtain the JSON file containing credentials of the service account created, this can be followed to do the same : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWcLDax-VmM
- The created JSON file must be added to the root directory of the project. In the file `app.py` on line 14,  `os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = 'Path to your Service account JSON credentials file'` must be replaced with the path to the JSON file.
- On successful installation of streamlit  `streamlit run app.py` to run the application on `localhost 8501`
