# Translate-non-editable-PDFs

- Performing Google Translate on non-editable PDF's or PDF's that are created from images is not possible. The only solution to extract text from these documents is to perform *OCR* or Optical Character Recognition.
- The use case which I encountered was to convert such files in Dutch to English, it has been extended to provide a facility to translate `from` and `to` any language.
